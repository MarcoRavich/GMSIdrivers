This never happened to me, but I don't guarantee it won't happen to
you.


Changelog
---------
0.2 Minor bugfix
0.1 First release


What you need:
--------------

ALSA 0.9.0rc6 package, configured and installed.
 (maybe it also works with OSS, but I didn't test this)
 
 We will use the generic maestro-2E driver provided by ALSA.
 
INSTALLATION:
-------------
For extensive docs see the INSTALL file.

1) go to the directory maxiinit-0.1/maxiinit/lib
2) remove all .o and .a files & type 'make'
3) when this is successfull, go back to the 
   directory maxiinit-0.1
4) execute './configure'
5) execute 'make'
6) execute 'make install' as root

RUNNING
-------

Make sure you have the firmware file provided by guillemot. It's called
PCI64.BIN and is located in the windows directory.
Copy this file to your linux filesystem (eg to /etc/isis/pci64.bin).

execute the program using the firmware location as first argument:
(IMPORTANT: you must be root!)

  # maxiinit /etc/isis/pci64.bin

The program will display some of output. If it encounters errors, it will
notify you. Should it not work, send me an email with the output of the
program.

If the program succeeds, you can load the ALSA driver for the MAESTRO-2E.
(note: you can load this module before executing the program (eg in the INIT
script) but you won't have any sound until this is executed.
